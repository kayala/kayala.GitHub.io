## Jie's Pages

I am an electronic engineer from China, currently living in Dresden, Germany. This is my personal page to introduce my self. You can also have a look on my german resume ([Lebenslauf](https://github.com/kayala/kayala.GitHub.io/blob/main/Lebenslauf_Jie.pdf)).

I am very interested in the field of software development and algorithm optimization.

I successfully completed my master's degree in electrical engineering at TU Dresden. I did a lot of deep learning research in my studies. I did a deep comparison and research on CNNs and optimized them in hardware and accelerated them in software.

After graduation I worked for TU Dresden for two years as a research assistant. At work I have increased my research on parallel algorithms and architectures. I have an in-depth understanding of existing acceleration algorithms and architectures, and developed parallel acceleration algorithms for radar detection.
Embedded development is also my area of interest, I like to develop applications and drivers on STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi. And I also learned to use QT for graphical interface development. 

If you're interested, you can see a brief introduction to projects I've worked on here.

### Converlutional neural networks

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm, is often utilized for classification and computer vision tasks.

For example, LeNet (or LeNet-5) is a basic convolutional neural network structure proposed in 1989, which can be applied for recognizing MNIST handwritten digit images. Here is an example for [Recognition MNIST handwritten digit images](https://github.com/kayala/project/tree/main/CNNs).

In convolutional neural networks, the computation of convolution is repeated a lot. Therefore, the power consumption of the device can be significantly affected by changing the calculation accuracy of the convolution in the low-power device, which is of great significance to the design of the computing unit.

### Mesh networks
