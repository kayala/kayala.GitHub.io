## Jie's Pages

I am an electronic engineer from China, currently living in Dresden, Germany. This is my personal page to introduce my self. You can also have a look on my german resume[Lebenslauf](https://github.com/kayala/kayala.GitHub.io/blob/main/Lebenslauf_Jie.pdf)

I am very interested in the field of software development and algorithm optimization.

I successfully completed my master's degree in electrical engineering at TU Dresden. I did a lot of deep learning research in my studies. I did a deep comparison and research on CNNs and optimized them in hardware and accelerated them in software.

After graduation I worked for TU Dresden for two years as a research assistant. At work I have increased my research on parallel algorithms and architectures. I have an in-depth understanding of existing acceleration algorithms and architectures, and developed parallel acceleration algorithms for radar detection.
Embedded development is also my area of interest, I like to develop applications and drivers on STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi. And I also learned to use QT for graphical interface development. 

If you're interested, you can see a brief introduction to projects I've worked on here.

### CNNs

Build [CNNs](https://github.com/kayala/project/tree/main/CNNs) for MNIST.

### Mesh networks 

Build [Mesh Networks](https://github.com/kayala/project/tree/main/mesh_network) on ESP32.

### EEPROM ON STM32

Driver for [EEPROM and NTP](https://github.com/kayala/project/tree/main/stm32) on STM32.

### Radar algorithm
