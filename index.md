## Jie Liu's Pages

I am an electronic engineer from China, currently living in Dresden, Germany. This is my personal page to introduce my self. You can also read the [deutsche Version](https://kayala.GitHub.io/german/).

I am very interested in the field of software development and algorithm optimization.

I successfully completed my master's degree in electrical engineering at TU Dresden. I did a lot of deep learning research in my studies. I did a deep comparison and research on CNNs and optimized them in hardware and accelerated them in software.

After graduation I worked for TU Dresden for two years as a research assistant. At work I have increased my research on parallel algorithms and architectures. I have an in-depth understanding of existing acceleration algorithms and architectures, and developed parallel acceleration algorithms for radar detection.
Embedded development is also my area of interest, I like to develop applications and drivers on STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi. And I also learned to use QT for graphical interface development. 

这里有个我做过的项目展示 [project presentation](https://kayala.GitHub.io/project/).
